# ClientObserver

The goal of the app is to view various forms of data (images, live stream, sound) from a source. Currently the source is a Raspberry Pi (RPI) doing object detection using TF llite models. The app can receive data in the form of pictures, text and videos from the RPI in real time. The app client can connect to different sources and receive data from them in real time.


 Future plans for this project include incorporating more types of data (audio), seperating the source and the server, incorporating vehciles.
 
 I want the app to be able to receive audio data in a simliar fashion to that of visual. My interest is in precision agrculture and this could be used to monitor animal populations bats etc.. 

 Instead of the RPI acting both as the source and the server I want to have a seperate server that can help process and store data either on the cloud or locally. 

 Incorporating vehciles such as drones is a big step and receiving the stream should be quite similar but to automate the driving is going to be the beast to tame.
