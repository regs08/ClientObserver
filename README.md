# ClientObserver

The goal of the app is to view various forms of data (images, live stream, sound) from a source. Currently the source is a Raspberry Pi (RPI) doing object detection using TF llite models. The app can receive data in the form of pictures, text and videos from the RPI in real time. The app client can connect to different sources and receive data from them in real time.
